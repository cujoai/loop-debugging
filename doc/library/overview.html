<p>The LOOP package provides a library of classes implemented using its models.
All classes included in its library were created or derived from actual implementations used in either academic or commercial applications, and many are reused in more than one application.
Therefore, even though the classes presented here are provided mainly as use examples of LOOP models they are very useful for construction of software applications.</p>

<p>Most of these classes were initially created as Lua conventional modules and were later converted to classes so it is straightforward to convert them back to modules that don't lay on LOOP.
Some of these classes can even be used as an instance of itself thus avoiding the creation of singleton objects.
However, in some scenarios, it is interesting to be able to have multiple instances.
The LOOP Class Library is organized in six groups as presented below.</p>

<h2><a name="debug">Debugging</a></h2>

<p>This group contains classes useful for instrumentation of Lua code or implementation of logging mechanisms for applications.
These classes usually perform slow operations or use of the debug API of Lua and therefore should not be used heavily in implementation of performance critical applications.</p>

<dl>

<dt><a href="debug/Viewer.html">Value Viewer</a></dt>
<dd>
	<p>Class of objects that generate human-readable textual representation of Lua values.
	This class is typically used to print out value of variables, data structures or objects in a Lua application using a syntax similar to the Lua language.
	It is useful for implementation of command line debug mechanisms.
	This class can also be used as a simple serialization mechanism for a restricted set of Lua values.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a href="debug/Matcher.html">Value Matcher</a></dt>
<dd>
	<p>Class of objects used to compare pairs of values according to some criteria of similarity.
	By default, it matches pairs of same values or structurally isomorphic tables (including their meta-tables).
	Functions with same bytecodes, upvalue contents and isomorphic environments also match.
	However, such matching criteria may be redefined.
	This class is useful for implementing automated test mechanisms for Lua applications.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a href="debug/Inspector.html">Code Inspector</a></dt>
<dd>
	<p>Class of objects that implement a command-line prompt to access the lexical scope of a point in an application.
	The command-line prompt also allows to navigate through active co-rotines and access the lexical scope of the point they are currently executing.
	It is also possible to navigate to inactive functions in order to access the current value of their upvalues.
	This class is useful for implementation of command-line debugging mechanisms.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a href="debug/Verbose.html">Verbose Manager</a></dt>
<dd>
	<p>Class of objects that provide operations to generate and manage verbose messages of a continuous application.
	All messages are flagged and may be hierarchly organized in order to reflect the application structure.
	The flagged messages can be turned on/off by flag or group of flags.
	The messages also provide support for indentation in order to reflect the hierarchical structure of function calls in the application.
	This class is useful for implementation of logging mechanisms in server applications.</p>
</dd>
